I need an ICP canister that has the following data structures:

Sensor: {
    sensor_id: string,
    sensor_type: enum: {GSM, LORA, GATEWAY_GSM, GATEWAY_WIFI},
    owner: principal,
    assign_type: enum: {OWNER default, PROJECT},
    project_id: string,
    purchase_date
    transaction: {
        chainID: BigUint64Array,
        txhash: string,
        token_type: enum: {NATIVE, ERC20},
        contract_address: string,
        amount: number,
        from_address: string,
    },
    status: enum {
        PRESALE,
        PROCESSING_FOR_SHIPPING,
        SHIPPED,
        DEPLOYED,
        OFFLINE,
        QUERY (something strange - eg. purchase price etc.)
    }
}

I need a function to purchase a sensor, the function should update the sensor object with the transaction details. I'll add the logic to check the token transfer later.
The function parameters need to be the sensor_id, transaction hash, the caller principal, purchase amount (in wei), token type, contract address, and from address.
(I will do the transaction on the front end and use chain fusion to confirm the transaction - I already have code for that so don't worry here)
Tokens are only created on purchase. Transaction details need to never be changed.

I need to be able to list sensors by:
owner principal
project
sensor type (and purchase date range)

and then get a count per sensor type


I also need the follpowing data type:
User {
    principal
    address (evm address),
    discord_handle
}

I need to be able to look up user by principal, address or discord_handle

I also need a function to create a super admin - this os an anonymous function if there is no super admin, otherwise only a super admin can change it
And then a function to add and remove admins - done by super admin

the following functions are managed by admins:
edit sensor_status
edit assign_type and project_id

Please feel free to ask questions for clarity before coding


I also need a list of tokens accepted:
[{
    token_id (for reference)
    chain_id,
    rpc_url,
    token_type enum {NATIVE, ERC20},
    contract address
}..]

Only admins can add to, remove or edit this

And then a list of sensor prices:
[{
    sensor_type: [
        {token_id, amount}
    ]
}...]

Only admins can add to, remove or edit this

I need to be able to get the full list of tokens accepted
I need to be able to look up prices by token_id(s)
Anyone has access to this
